m&mf People Tracker
======================
Just use any of the people-locating methods - scent, window - it'll plot people on your map.

You can disable it or easily change color of labels in it's **mmconfig2** menu entry, along with the font size of labels.

The script works in tandem with the `Mudlet Mapper script <http://wiki.mudlet.org/w/IRE_mapping_script#Download>`_, and thus the latest version is required - or **12.5.10 at minimum**!

* if it's not possible to tell where exactly a person is, like when they're in a room with a non-unique name, then it'll put identifiers into all rooms that match and only put the list of people in the right-most room. This seems the best way to deal with this problem so far, but if you have better ideas let me know

Comprehensive guide to setting this up
----------------------------------------
1) **Get the map open** - press the Map button in Mudlet or *Toolbox â†’ Show map* to spawn it. If you'd always like the map showing, `this script <http://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Mudlet_Mapper>`_ will help you do that. Don't worry if the map doens't track you / says invalid position or etc right now.

2) **Get the mapper script** - `go here <http://wiki.mudlet.org/w/IRE_mapping_script>`_ and install this script. If you already have it, remove it and install it - it is updated very often. After you install it, reconnect - that way it will know you're connected to Lusternia, and not another game.

3) **Get the map** - after you reconnected, opening the map should automatically download the map from the game - and you'll be set.
